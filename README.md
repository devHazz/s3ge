# Welcome to the project!

## About
This program is for allowing the user to upload custom graphics to Skate 3 on RPCS3 without hassle. This removes the need of the heavy manual work and is very easy to utilise.

## How-to use
Make sure that your `SKATER.P` has been copied to the files directory, then execute `go run main.go`

## Requirements
 - Windows ONLY
 - Go Version 1.18.x
 - PS3 `SKATER.P` File (Can be retrieved through RPCS3)
 - A skater with 4 existing graphics (Won't be a requirement in future builds)
